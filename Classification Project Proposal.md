# Classification Project Proposal

## Predicting Music Genre

For my project I plan to use a dataset of 42,000+ songs from Spotify to predict and classify the music genre. The genre categories are:
Dark Trap, Underground Rap, Trap Metal, Emo, Rap, RnB, Pop, Hiphop, techhouse, techno, trance, psytrance, trap, dnb, hardstyle.
Some of the total 13 feature columns include: daceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, valence, tempo. These metrics were originally scraped/obtained by the Reddit user with Spotify APIs.

I hope to gain some interesting insights into the defining characteristics of different music genres. After modeling, I plan to analyze the performance of my model using a confusion matrix.

This model could potentially benefit music streaming services to create recommender algorithms to users. The recommender could provide songs from the same genre that the user likes. Even though the model will not be 100% accurate, the misclassified genres could still suggest songs that are sonically similar. This can help the user to discover new music.
